# Things to eventually do

1. &String -> &'a str

1. Encrypt over byte slices instead of strings

1. Improve testing infrastructure (setup methods)

1. Unify `get_field()` vs `field()`

1. Re-export core things from TANK (qualified, not unqualified as rust::std does); or don't re-export - instead have app just instantiate Core separately
