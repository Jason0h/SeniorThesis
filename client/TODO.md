# Things to eventually do

1. &String -> &'a str

1. Better way to get messages from core to dalayer (callbacks)

1. Improve testing infrastructure (setup methods)

1. Unify `get_field()` vs `field()`

1. Re-export core things from noiseKV (qualified, not unqualified as rust::std does); or don't re-export - instead have app just instantiate Core separately

1. rustfmt.toml (80 char limit)
